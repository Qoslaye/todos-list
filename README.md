# Todo List App

This is a Todo List application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and styled with Tailwind CSS. This application allows users to manage their daily tasks by adding, updating, deleting, and viewing tasks efficiently.

## Project Overview

Initially, this assignment required a frontend-only solution. However, to enhance the functionality and provide a more complete demonstration of web development skills, I extended the project into a full MERN stack application. This approach not only showcases frontend capabilities but also demonstrates backend integration, making the application more robust and practical for real-world usage.

Although the deployment requirement was not fulfilled due to time constraints, screenshots have been included to illustrate the application's features and interface.

The project consists of two main pages:
- **Todo Page**: The main interface where users can manage their tasks.
- **Settings Page**: A basic setup for potential future enhancements, showcasing the use of React Router DOM for navigation between multiple pages.

## Features

- **Create Task**: Add new tasks to your list quickly and efficiently.
- **Edit Task**: Modify existing tasks to reflect new details.
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed, keeping your list up to date.
- **Responsive Design**: Built using Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience across all devices, including mobile and desktop.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface with intuitive icons for actions like update and delete, ensuring an easy navigation experience.
- **Settings Page**: Provides the framework for customizing application settings using React Router DOM, which can be expanded upon with additional functionality in the future.

## Group Collaboration

This project was developed collaboratively with my peers:
- Anisa Hussein
- Anab Shire
- Rowda Abshir
- Abdi Shakur

Our team worked together on both frontend and backend aspects to deliver a comprehensive application that meets and exceeds the project requirements. We utilized GitHub for version control and collaboration, ensuring a smooth development process and effective task distribution among team members.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces that enable efficient updates and rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows you to design responsive layouts quickly.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API, simplifying data fetching and handling.
- **React Router DOM**: Provides routing and navigation capabilities within the application, enabling a multi-page setup.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used to build scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, providing robust features for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that offers flexibility and scalability, used for storing tasks data.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, which provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.
